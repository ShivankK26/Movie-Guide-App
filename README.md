In this Project, I've built a Movie Guide App using omDb API through which you can search for any movie and get all the information related to it.


Use the `README.md` to get started.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
# Getting Started
To get started, first of all create the basic HTML and CSS files. In the CSS file, we'll use some webkits and Google Font API. We'll also use media queries. 

## Installation
After performing the above steps, we'll generate the omDb API from their official documentation.

* Google API

  ```sh
      https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@300;500;600;700&display=swap
      
  ```
* omDb API
  
  ```sh
      https://omdbapi.com/
  ```
